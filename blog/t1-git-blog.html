      <h5> What are the benefits of version control? </h1>
         There are probably endless benefits to version control - but I'm a newbie so I can only make basic assumptions from what tiny knowledge I've crammed into my head in the past 5 days. Mistakes might be a big one. Making mistakes and committing it to code and then realising that wasn't such a great idea and you wish you could go back? - version control. Want to compare the differences between what you have no and what you did? - version control. View the history of some code? - version control. Muck around and experiment with something new without mucking up the original? - version control.

        <h5>How does git help you keep track of changes? </h1>
        Besides giving you 3 stages of committing your edits to the code, git helps you keep track of those past changes with little commit messages that you can take a peak at with "git log"

        <h5>Why use GitHub to store your code? </h1>
        At the moment I don't know of any other place where developers can go to collaborate on projects together - I'd say they exist but GitHub seems like the most popular place to do it, with an ever expanding community.
