        The DBC experience so far is great, a lot of chatter and feedback already between all three cohorts on the Google community. I've already introduced myself as quiet and awkward, great job. Having said that, I like the early introduction (it's more like a shove) into mingling and having the commmunity support net early on.

      There's already a lot of emphasis already placed on interacting with the community - and although I'm not   too comfortable with this concept, only because I haven't experienced it much in the past/I've mostly avoided it, there's also a lot of emphasis on it being a safe environment for you/its student to open up and gain some mad knowledge on coding but life in general. This is an important lesson for me to learn, I definitely think I need to open up more and be more welcoming and accepting of the things in my life.

      After watching "fireside chat" with Shereef; I can definitely see myself in both mindsets, and I think I'm a little arrogant because of my career so far and incredibly worrisome because I think there are going to be a few people there who are well ahead of the game on this one. But I will definitely approach the whole experience with an open mind - and work on becoming a cook in the kitchen with everyone. As much as it is a learning experience (because lets be honest, you've thrown quite a bit of money at it) to me, the experience is equally important for me. I can definitely see myself making some great friends along the way :)

        Keeping it on the low - probably not for long - but I'm a little nervous learning remotely because I've lacked motivation to stick to it in the past ad have found myself dropping out after a few weeks. But the constant feedback between peers keeps you up to date and in-check with everything going on. So far I think I've stuck to the schedule - mostly... I definitely know what I need to work on this week, and jump into the challenges proactively.
