      Okay. I know what you're thinking. And what I'm thinking is the same thing.
      What are these things? Why are there 3? Why isn't there just 1? 
      What do they do? Are they even different? 
      I'm gonna drop some knowledge on this blog.
    </p>
    <p>Y'know and uh also.. I've been struggling with this for awhile.. so it's probably going to help me in the long run as much as it helps you.
     </p>
    <p>
        So long story short, they are all different from one another and they help position your elements on your webpage. You get to do all the juicy manipulation with CSS. Let's get into the nitty gritty.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Relative Positioning"</li>
    <p>
        Relative means "exactly where it would be if you let it where it was". So every change you make with positioning attributes to the element itself - we're talking: "top:100p" or "left:100px" - you're moving it from its current positiong using the orders you've effectively given it. In this case, 100px down and to the left from where it would normally be.
    </p>
    <p> 
      And you thought that was it.. nope! This guy does something else pretty neat - let's the element sit on top of other elements of the page.
    </p>

      <li>"Absolute Positioning"</li>
    <p>
        This guy - is the king of all positioning! Well at least in my opinion. I think the biggest thing to consider with this one - exactly the same with all the others "you get to move something around the page etc..", but if you apply this positioning attribute to an element - you dont affect the flow/dynamics of any other element on the page. Nor do the other elements affect an element with this attribute. 
    </p>

      <li>"Fixed Positioning"</li>
    <p>
        Ah... and last but not least. This guy is a bit of a mixed bag. You get feedback that its not common practice to use, and that there is a trade-off between keeping certain elements present at all times (perhaps you want a fixed floating nav bar available at all times?) but you for what's kept present and in its spot relative to the window (think... scrolling webpages with fixed elements) you may or may not end up losing quite a bit of usability eg/ your nav bar covering up your footer... nobody has time for that.
